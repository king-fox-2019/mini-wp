# TYPRESS

Wordpress-like app with RESTfull API. Using express js for routing and mongoDB with mongoose for database driver.



## Base Url

For local usage, the default url is

```http
http://localhost:3000
```

You can change the default port from 3000 if necessary (see Guide section below).



## Errors

There are multiple errors that might happen, and this section is intended to capture all those error, the cause, and possibly some ways to resolve the issue.

### 422: Unprocessable Entity

- User validation error: Often happens on Sign Up. Require you to check whether you've sent correct data, all required fields were filled, and all validation passed. Change all fields causing error, and resend your data. Example message: `Username Required`, `Email already registered`, `Password min length 6`.
- `Wrong username/email/password`: Happens on Sign In. Caused by missing fields, invalid data values, or probably you just havent's Sign Up yet. Fix all data, or change to the correct route if you happen to be in the last case, and try again.
- `Article title required`: Happens specifically when you are manipulating Article (creating, editing). Please check if you accidentally removed the  `article's title`.
- `Invalid article status`: This happens when you try to create/edit your article status with invalid value. Check whether you have set the status correctly, or just leave it blank so the API will take care of it using it's default value.

### 404: Not Found

- `Article not found`: This could happen when you try to access deleted article, or the `article's id` is invalid. Recheck the `article's id` or, if not sure, try to use Get All Articles route to see the correct `id` for that article.

### 401: Unauthorized

- `Valid access token required`: Could happen in endpoints where `access_token` is reequired, which means almost all route endpoints. The cause could be the `access_token` is invalid, missing, or broken. If this still persist after you try to fix it, try requesting new `access_token` from Sign In endpoint.
- `User not found`: This happens when your account has been removed from the system (banned).

### 403: Forbidden

- `Unauthorized access to this article`: This means you are trying to modify (edit, delete) articles which is not authorised by you. If that's not the case, it's possibly because of incorrect `id`. Try to check it and make sure you were accessing the correct article.
